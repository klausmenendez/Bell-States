# Bell-States
Bell State Fidelity Analysis Under Noise and Real Quantum Hardware

Overview:
 This project constructs the 4 bell states and tests their robustness under:
  Ideal simulation
Controlled depolarizing noise models
Real quantum hardware controlled by IBM
The goal is to compare theoretical fidelity with that of empirical hardware performance and quantify how entanglement degrades under realistic noise

Motivation:
Entanglement is a key concept in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum encryption. Under ideal conditions the bell states have perfect coherence. However under sufficient noise the fidelity between ideal bell states and bell states measured on quantum hardware decreases
This project explores:
 How depolarizing noise affects entanglement
How closely quantum hardware recreates ideal states 
Methodology:
Generate Bell States using Qiskit
Extract exact state vector representation
Use to later calculate fidelity
Noise Model Simulation:
A depolarizing noise model is applied where:
1-qubit error probability is 2%
2-qubit error probability is 5%
Noise is added to:
H gates
CX gates
Fidelity is computed using F(pideal,pnoisy) where p is a density matrix 
Real Hardware Simulation:
Connect to least busy backend
Transpile circuit for hardware topology 
Execute via sampler primitive
Estimate fidelity 
The fidelity is estimated by summing probabilities of correlated outcomes:
Fidelity of  statesp(00)+p(11)
Fidelity of  statesp(01)+p(10)
Results:
Key observations:
2 cubit noise dominates fidelity loss
Entanglement is highly sensitive to cx errors
Hardware fidelity reflects calibration quality (how much noise is generated by the hardware)
Technologies Used:
python
Qiskit
Qiskit Aer
IBM Quantum Runtime
Density Matrix Simulation
Depolarizing Noise Channels
